== Description ==

This plugin adds functionality such as navigation and post-processing for GitHub / markkdown source material for sites showing the Creative Commons Certification. It can be used for a "publisher" type site for modifying source content from GitHub, or modifying an HTML from export from a publisher site. 

It can then be used on a 'producer" site, e.g. one created by export of a publisher site, to customize content, or any other site that uses an export of a producer site

These need to be added as a check on activation with [TGM Plugin Activation](http://tgmpluginactivation.com/) 

* [Page-List](https://wordpress.org/plugins/page-list/) for displaying the navigation

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
2. This is the second screen shot
